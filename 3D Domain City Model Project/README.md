# 🏙️ GDG AR/VR — 3D Domain City Model Project

Welcome to the **GDG AR/VR 3D Domain City Project** 🏙️  
This is an **open-source Blender modeling initiative** to build a **single combined 3D model set** representing **all GDG domains as buildings**, designed for **AR/VR experiences and website showcases**.

Each contributor will work on **one building (one domain)**.  
All buildings will be combined into a **mini tech city**, with a **central GDG building as the tallest landmark**.

---

## 📸 Visual Reference
- Use the **GDG domain website reference image** provided in the repository.
- Each domain card represents the **idea and theme** of the building.
- Final result should feel like a **technology city**, not separate random models.

## 🎯 Project Concept (Read First)

### Final Output
- A **combined 3D city-style model**
- Each **domain = one building**
- **Central tallest building = GDG Main**
- Use cases:
  - AR/VR scenes
  - Website 3D embeds
  - Promotional visuals

---

## 🏗️ City Layout Idea
- GDG Main Building placed at the **center**
- Domain buildings arranged **around it**
- Clean spacing so each building is reusable individually
- ❌ No humans, vehicles, or environment props

---

## 🛠 General Rules (Important)
- Tool: **Blender only**
- Apply **Scale + Rotation** (`Ctrl + A`)
- Keep models **low–mid poly** (AR/VR optimized)
- **UV unwrap everything**
- ❌ No animations required
- Textures optional (simple materials preferred)
- Pivot / Origin should be logical
- Save files as **`.blend`**
- ❌ No copyrighted assets
