# 🏙️ GDG AR/VR — 3D Domain City Model Project

Welcome to the **GDG AR/VR 3D Domain City Project** 🏙️  
This is an **open-source Blender modeling initiative** to build a **single combined 3D model set** representing **all GDG domains as buildings**, designed for **AR/VR experiences and website showcases**.

Each contributor will work on **one building (one domain)**.  
All buildings will be combined into a **mini tech city**, with a **central GDG building as the tallest landmark**.

---

## 📸 Visual Reference
- Use the **GDG domain website reference image** provided in the repository.
- Each domain card represents the **idea and theme** of the building.
- Final result should feel like a **technology city**, not separate random models.

## 🎯 Project Concept (Read First)

### Final Output
- A **combined 3D city-style model**
- Each **domain = one building**
- **Central tallest building = GDG Main**
- Use cases:
  - AR/VR scenes
  - Website 3D embeds
  - Promotional visuals

---

## 🏗️ City Layout Idea
- GDG Main Building placed at the **center**
- Domain buildings arranged **around it**
- Clean spacing so each building is reusable individually
- ❌ No humans, vehicles, or environment props

---

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines (3D Domain City Project)
Please read it before starting your work.
- One contributor works on **one domain building only**
- Choose the correct domain folder before starting
- Follow the **GDG domain visual reference**
- The building must visually represent the domain concept
- Models must be:
  - Low–mid poly
  - AR/VR optimized
  - Clean topology
- ❌ No environment props (humans, vehicles, trees, roads, etc.)
- ❌ No animations
- Apply **Scale & Rotation (Ctrl + A)**
- UV unwrap all meshes
- Simple materials preferred (textures optional)
- Logical pivot/origin placement
- Save and submit files as `.blend`
