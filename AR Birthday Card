The goal is to create an Augmented Reality (AR) Birthday Greeting Card that provides an interactive and engaging experience for the user using Unity and Vuforia.
When the user scans a physical birthday card (or marker/image), an AR experience should appear on the screen with animated birthday elements and a personalized greeting.

Expected Functionality
-User scans a birthday card (image marker or surface)
-AR content appears on top of the card in real time
-Birthday-themed animations are displayed (cake, balloons, confetti, etc.)
-A birthday message is shown (text or voice)
-Optional background music or sound effects play

Key Features
-Image/Marker Recognition: Detects the marker
-3D AR Elements: Cake, candles, balloons, gifts, confetti
-Animated Text: “Happy Birthday” message with name customization
-Smooth Interaction: Stable AR tracking and performance

Submission Requirements
-Unity Project File: Complete Unity project including all assets, scenes, and scripts
-Demo Video: A short demo video clearly demonstrate the working AR Birthday Greeting Card experience.
