- Include project documentation with:
  - Concept Explanation
  - Development Process
  - Challenges faced
- Zip your files into a single archive named: SuperpowerSelfie_YourName.zip


### 2. AR Business Card
**Description:**
Create an interactive AR business card using Unity and AR Foundation. Design a 3D model of a business card that comes to life when viewed through an AR device. Implement engaging interactions such as tapping on the card to reveal additional details, play animations, or display contact information. The project should offer a seamless and immersive experience for users.

**Requirements and Features:**
- Design an engaging 3D business card model.
- Implement intuitive user interactions, such as tapping for additional info or animations.
- Use AR Foundation and Vuforia to bring the card to life in AR.
- Ensure smooth, responsive performance across different devices.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit a video demonstration showing the AR business card in action.
- Include the complete source code and project files.
- Provide project documentation, including a brief overview of the design and technical aspects.
- Zip your files into a single archive named: BusinessCard_YourName.zip


### 3. 3D Room Revamp
**Description:**
Enhance the provided .blend file containing a basic room structure. The task is to transform the room into a visually appealing and functional space by adding details such as furniture, lighting, textures, or any other creative elements. The goal is to showcase your design and modeling skills while maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing environment.

**Requirements and Features:**
- Incorporate furniture, decor, and other assets to make the room feel alive.
- Apply appropriate materials and textures to all elements for a polished look.
- Use lighting effectively to enhance the mood and ambiance of the room.
- Keep the file size and complexity manageable while maintaining visual quality.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit the final project in .blend format, ensuring compatibility with Blender 3.x. onwards.
- Also submit a photo and a video showcasing your project in the final view (snapshot of the viewport and a rendered image/ video tour of the room).
- Zip your files into a single archive named: RoomRevamp_YourName.zip


### 4. Game Development Project

**Description:**
Develop an interactive and engaging game using any game development platform of your choice (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etc.). This can be a 2D or 3D game, a puzzle, adventure, action, or simulation game—there are no specific style restrictions. The project should be original and it must showcase your creativity. No pre-built templates allowed without significant customization. The goal is to create a fun, playable game with an intuitive user experience. Use your creativity to design game mechanics, visuals, and sound, and bring your ideas to life in an interactive environment.

**Features:**
- Choose any genre (2D or 3D, puzzle, action, adventure, etc.).
- Implement core game mechanics (movement, combat, progression, etc.).
- Include interactive elements like buttons, menus, or achievements.
- Try to enhance the game with visuals, sound effects, and music.
- Ensure the game runs smoothly and is playable on the target platform (PC, mobile).

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit the game in a playable format (e.g., executable file, app, or web link).
- Provide a short demo video (30-60 seconds) showcasing the gameplay.
- Include project documentation with:
  - Concept Explanation
  - Game Mechanics Overview
  - Development Process and Tools Used
  - Challenges faced
- Zip your files into a single archive named: GameDev_YourName.zip.
